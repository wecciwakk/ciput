### CHAPTER 1 ###

…Do you know who Misaki is? The one in third-year Class 3? Did you hear the story?

Misaki? Is that someone’s name?

Yeah. No one knows what characters it’s written with. It could be a last name, so it’s not evennecessarily a girl. Either way, Misaki So-and-so or So-and-so Misaki, there was a student named Misaki twenty-six years ago.

Twenty-six years? Wow, that’s a long time. That’s back with the last emperor.

1972. The forty-second year of Emperor Hirohito’s reign. I think that was the year Okinawa was returned.

Okinawa came back? From where?

Are you stupid? America was occupying it up till then, ever since the war ended.

Oh, so that’s why there’re still all those graves.

Now that I think about it, the Winter Games were in Sapporo that year, too. Pretty sure the Mount Asama Lodge incident was, too…

What lodge on Mount Asama?

Are you for real? Whatever, I guess. Anyway. What matters is, twenty-six years ago, there was a student named Misaki in Class 3 of the third-years. And then… are you sure you never heard this story before?

Hmm…hold on. You’re saying the kid was named Misaki? Not Masaki? If it’s Ma-saki, then yeah, I heard a little bit about it. 

Masaki? Huh. Maybe it’s like that in some versions. Who’d you hear it from?

An upperclassman in my club.

What’d he say?

I dunno if it was twenty-six years ago, but there was a third-year student named Masaki a long, long time ago… and, um…the way I heard it, it was a boy. And something really weird happened in his class that year. But my upperclassman said it’s a secret, and you’re not supposed to go around talking about it. So he said he couldn’t tell me anything else.

That’s it?

Yeah. He said, “If you joke around about it, bad things will happen to you.” I bet you it’s one of those things. “The Seven Mysteries.”

You think so?

You know how piccolo music starts playing in the music room in the middle of the night when no one’s around, or how sometimes a hand all covered in blood reaches out of the lotus pond in the school yard? So I figure, maybe this is the seventh one.

I heard that the mannequins in the home ec room have actual heartbeats.

They totally do!

There’s a ton besides that. I know like nine or ten of the “Seven Mysteries” at this middle school. But this story about Misaki or Masaki or whatever it was… I don’t think it’s one of those. Most of the stories feel pretty different from the rest of the “Seven Mysteries.”

Wow, really? So you know the details?

A little, I guess.

Tell me!

What, you don’t care if something bad happens to me?

That’s just a superstition, obviously.

Yeah, you’re probably right.

So tell me!

Actually, I don’t know if I should…

Come on! I’ll never ask you for anything else!

And how many times now has it been the last thing you’ll ever ask me for?

Heh-heh.

Oh, for crying out loud. If I tell you, you can’t go blabbing to everyone you know.

I won’t tell anyone. I swear.

Hmmph. Okay…

Awesome.
